:information_source: We changed the default branch name to `main`. You can find the necessary steps to update your local clone on [Scott Hanselman's Blog](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx).  
We encourage you to rename the default branch in your forks too.

## What is the OpenKit?

The OpenKit provides an easy and lightweight way to get insights into applications with Dynatrace/AppMon by instrumenting the source code of those applications.

It is best suited for applications running separated from their backend and communicating via HTTP, like rich-client-applications, embedded devices, terminals, and so on.

The big advantages of the OpenKit are that it's designed to
* be as easy-to-use as possible
* be as dependency-free as possible, except for an SSL library (no Dynatrace/AppMon Agent needed)
* be easily portable to other languages and platforms

This repository contains the reference implementation in C and C++. Other implementations are listed as follows:
* Java: https://github.com/Dynatrace/openkit-java/
* .NET: https://github.com/Dynatrace/openkit-dotnet/
* JavaScript: https://github.com/Dynatrace/openkit-js/

## What you can do with the OpenKit
* Create Sessions and User Actions
* Report values, events, errors and crashes
* Trace web requests to server-side PurePaths
* Tag Sessions with a user tag
* Use it together with Dynatrace or AppMon

## What you cannot do with the OpenKit
* Create server-side PurePaths (this functionality is provided by [OneAgent SDKs](https://github.com/Dynatrace/OneAgent-SDK))
* Create metrics (use the [Custom network devices & metrics API](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/timeseries/what-does-the-custom-network-devices-and-metrics-api-provide/) to report metrics)

## Design Principles
* API should be as simple and easy-to-understand as possible
* Incorrect usage of the OpenKit should still lead to valid results, if possible
* In case of errors, the API should not throw exceptions, but only log those errors (in verbose mode)
* All third-party libraries, except for an SSL library, are included as source and built together with OpenKit
* Avoid usage of C++ standard newer than C++11, older compilers should work as well
* Avoid usage of compiler specific extensions to support a broad variety of C++ compilers
* Design reentrant APIs and document them

## General Remarks

* All non binary files within the repository (except for 3rd party files) are formatted with unix style (LF) line endings.
