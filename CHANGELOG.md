# OpenKit Native ( C/C++ ) Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/Dynatrace/openkit-native/compare/v1.1.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Support for parsing JSON
- Technology type support for errors and crashes
- Support for session splitting. Sessions are split transparently after either the maximum session duration,
  the idle timeout or the number of top level actions are exceeded.

### Security
- Support for modified UTF-8 terminated strings.

### Changed
- On OpenKitBuilder creation device ID is parsed from the given string. Non-numeric
  device IDs are hashed to a corresponding numeric value. Internally a numeric
  type is used for the device ID.
- Fix incorrect check in C-API's useBeaconCacheBehaviorForConfiguration function when setting the
  upper memory bound.
- Response code is now a parameter of IWebRequestTracer's stop function
  (stopWebRequestWithResponseCode in C API).
  Existing functions for stopping and setting the response code have been deprecated.
- Fixed Unix compile issue regarding zlib.h in CMakeLists.txt file
- Sleep calls in BeaconSender are interruptible to ensure OpenKit can be shutdown in time
- OpenKit version is parsed from version.properties file
- Application ID and Device ID are correctly encoded for special characters
  The encoding is a percent-encoding based on RFC 3986 with additional encoding of underscore characters.
- Remove "Enable minimal rebuild" compiler flag (MSVC only)
  In recent MSVC compilers this flag got marked as deprecated
- BeaconSender thread was stopped too early and did not flush sessions
- Fixed problem with infinite time sync requests
  This problem occurred mainly in AppMon settings.
- OpenKit::createSession method accepts nullptr as IP address
  In case nullptr is passed, the IP is determined on the server side.
- Reduce warnings when building on Linux
- Fix compiler errors for certain Visual Studio versions
- Fix `leaveAction` in `RootAction` so that the `mEndTime` and `mEndSequenceNumber` is set before 
  the root action is added to the `Beacon`.
- Add IOpenKit::createSession overload without IP address parameter.  
  The IP address is determined in this case on the server side.

### Improvements
- Reformatted text files to unix style line endings (excluding 3rd party files)

  A WebRequestTracer can also be obtained from a Session
