# Supported OpenKit C/C++ versions

The following table gives an overview of supported OpenKit Native (C/C++) versions.

As OpenKit applies the principles of [semantic versioning][semver] only the latest bugfix
releases are actively maintained for a major-minor version pair.  
Example: Version `1.1.7` supersedes `1.1.6` and therefore only `1.1.7` will be maintained.
