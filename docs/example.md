# Dynatrace OpenKit - C/C++ Example

The following document provides an in depth overview, how OpenKit can be used from
developer's point of view. It explains the usage of all the C and C++ API methods.

:grey_exclamation: Be aware that mixing the C and C++ API is not possible.
The developer is supposed to stick to one of the two APIs depending on the requirements.

## Obtaining an OpenKit Instance

Depending on the backend a new OpenKit instance can be obtained by using either `DynatraceOpenKitBuilder` 
or `AppMonOpenKitBuilder` when using the C++ API. Despite from this, the developer does not need to distinguish between 
different backend systems.

When using the OpenKit C API a new OpenKit instance can be obtained by calling either the `createDynatraceOpenKit` 
or the `createAppMonOpenKit` function. Despite from this, the developer does not need to distinguish between 
different backend systems.

### Dynatrace

For Dynatrace SaaS and Dynatrace Managed the `DynatraceOpenKitBuilder` (C++ API) is used to build new OpenKit instances.

```c++
// C++ API
const char* applicationID = "application-id";
uint64_t deviceID = 42;
const char* endpointURL = "https://tenantid.beaconurl.com/mbeacon";

std::shared_ptr<openkit::IOpenKit> openKit = DynatraceOpenKitBuilder(endpointURL, applicationID, deviceID).build();
```

* The `endpointURL` denotes the Dynatrace endpoint OpenKit communicates with and 
  is shown when creating the application in Dynatrace. The endpoint URL can be found 
  in the settings page of the custom application in Dynatrace.
* The `applicationID` parameter is the unique identifier of the application in Dynatrace Saas. The
  application's id can be found in the settings page of the custom application in Dynatrace.
* The `deviceID` is a unique identifier, which might be used to uniquely identify a device.

When using the OpenKit C API the three parameters described above are used to create an `OpenKitConfiguration` handle.
The DynatraceOpenKit is built using this handle. All parameters described in the Optional Configuration
can be applied to the configuration. The OpenKitConfiguration handle is owned by the caller and needs to be cleared after
creating the DyntraceOpenKit.

```c
// C API
const char* applicationID = "application-id";
int64_t deviceID = 42;
const char* endpointURL = "https://tenantid.beaconurl.com/mbeacon";

struct OpenKitConfigurationHandle* configurationHandle = createOpenKitConfiguration(beaconURL, applicationID, serverID);

struct OpenKitHandle* openKitHandle = createDynatraceOpenKit(configurationHandle);
destroyOpenKitConfiguration(configurationHandle);

```

:grey_exclamation: For Dynatrace Managed the endpoint URL looks a bit different.


### AppMon

An OpenKit instance for AppMon can be obtained by using the `AppMonOpenKitBuilder` (C++ API).

```c++
const char* applicationName = "My OpenKit application";
int64_t deviceID = 42;
const char* endpointURL = "https://beaconurl.com/dynaTraceMonitor";

std::shared_ptr<openkit::IOpenKit> openKit = AppMonOpenKitBuilder(endpointURL, applicationName, deviceID).build();
```

* The `endpointURL` denotes the AppMon endpoint OpenKit communicates with.
* The `applicationName` parameter is the application's name in AppMon and is also used as the application's id.
* The `deviceID` is a unique identifier, which might be used to uniquely identify a device.

When using the OpenKit C API the three parameters described above are used to create an `OpenKitConfiguration` handle.
The AppMonOpenKit is built using this handle. All parameters described in the Optional Configuration
can be applied to the configuration object.  The OpenKitConfiguration handle is owned by the caller and needs to be cleared after
creating the AppMonOpenKit.

```c
// C API
const char* applicationID = "application-id";
int64_t deviceID = 42;
const char* endpointURL = "https://tenantid.beaconurl.com/mbeacon";

struct OpenKitConfigurationHandle* configurationHandle = createOpenKitConfiguration(beaconURL, applicationID, serverID);

struct OpenKitHandle* openKitHandle = createAppMonOpenKit(configurationHandle);
destroyOpenKitConfiguration(configurationHandle);

```

### Optional Configuration

In addition to the mandatory parameters described above, both the `DynatraceOpenKitBuilder` and the `AppMonOpenKitBuilder` 
provide additional methods to further  customize OpenKit.
This includes device specific information like operating system, manufacturer, or model id.  

| Method Name | Description | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `withApplicationVersion`  | sets the application version  | `"1.0.3"` |
| `withOperatingSystem`  | sets the operating system name | `"OpenKit 1.0.3"` |
| `withManufacturer`  | sets the manufacturer | `"Dynatrace"` |
| `withModelID`  | sets the model id  | `"OpenKitDevice"` |
| `withBeaconCacheMaxRecordAge`  | sets the maximum age of an entry in the beacon cache in milliseconds | 1 h 45 min |
| `withBeaconCacheLowerMemoryBoundary`  | sets the lower memory boundary of the beacon cache in bytes  | 100 MB |
| `withBeaconCacheUpperMemoryBoundary`  |  sets the upper memory boundary of the beacon cache in bytes | 80 MB |
| `withDataCollectionLevel` | sets the data collection level (enum DataCollectionLevel) | USER_BEHAVIOR |
| `withCrashReportingLevel` | sets the crash reporting level (enum CrashReportingLevel) | OPT_IN_CRASHES |
| `enableVerbose`  | enables extended log output for OpenKit if the default logger is used  | `false` |

When using the OpenKit C API, additional configuration can applied to the configuration created with the
'createOpenKitConfiguration' function.

| Parameter Name | Description | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `useApplicationVersionForConfiguration`  | sets the application version  | `"1.0.3"` is used when argument is `NULL` |
| `useOperatingSystemForConfiguration`  | sets the operating system name | `"OpenKit 1.0.3"` is used when argument is `NULL` |
| `useManufacturerForConfiguration`  | sets the manufacturer | `"Dynatrace"` is used when argument is `NULL` |
| `useModelIDForConfiguration`  | sets the model id  | `"OpenKitDevice"` is used when argument is `NULL` |
| `useBeaconCacheMaxRecordAgeForConfiguration`  | sets the maximum age of an entry in the beacon cache in milliseconds | 1 h 45 min when argument is less than 0 |
| `useBeaconCacheLowerMemoryBoundaryForConfiguration`  | sets the lower memory boundary of the beacon cache in bytes  | 100 MB when argument is less than 0 |
| `useBeaconCacheUpperMemoryBoundaryForConfiguration`  |  sets the upper memory boundary of the beacon cache in bytes | 80 MB when argument is less than 0 |
| `useDataCollectionLevelForConfiguration` | sets the data collection level (enum DataCollectionLevel) | USER_BEHAVIOR |
| `useCrashReportingLevelForConfiguration` | sets the crash reporting level (enum CrashReportingLevel) | OPT_IN_CRASHES |

When passing a non-NULL `logger`, custom logging can be enabled. Further information is described in Logger.
When passing a non-NULL `trustManagerHandle`, custom SSL/TLS certificate verification can be enabled.
Further details are described in SSL/TLS Security in OpenKit.


:grey_exclamation: Please refer to the the Doxygen API documentation for more information regarding possible configuration values.

## SSL/TLS Security in OpenKit

All OpenKit communication to the backend happens via HTTPS (TLS/SSL based on libcurl included in 3rdparty folder).
By default OpenKit expects valid server certificates.
However it is possible, if really needed, to bypass TLS/SSL certificate validation. This can be achieved by
passing an implementation of `SSLTrustManager` by calling the `withTrustManager` on the builder (C++ API).

For OpenKit C API it is possible to bypass the TLS/SSL certificate validation by passing a custom `trustManagerHandle`
to the `createDynatraceOpenKit` or `createAppMonOpenKit` functions.

:warning: We do **NOT** recommend bypassing TLS/SSL server certificate validation, since this allows
man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Logging

By default, OpenKit uses a logger implementation that logs to stdout. If the default logger is used, verbose 
logging can be enabled by calling `enableVerbose` in the builder. By enabling verbose mode, info and debug
messages are logged. This only applies to the C++ API.

A custom logger can be set by calling `withLogger` in the builder. When a custom logger is used, a call to 
`enableVerbose` has no effect. In that case, debug and info logs are logged depending on the values returned 
in `isDebugEnabled` and `isInfoEnabled`.

When using the OpenKit C API a custom logger can be set by invoking `createLogger` function to create one.
The returned value can then be passed to the `createDynatraceOpenKit` or `createAppMonOpenKit` functions.
After OpenKit has been shut down, the custom logger shall be destroyed by invoking the `destroyLogger` function.

## Initializing OpenKit

When obtaining an OpenKit instance from the OpenKit builder the instance starts an automatic 
initialization phase. By default, initialization is performed asynchronously. 

There might be situations when a developer wants to ensure that initialization is completed before proceeding with 
the program logic. For example, short-lived applications where a valid init and shutdown cannot be guaranteed. In
such a case `waitForInitCompletion` can be used.

```c++
// C++ API
// wait until the OpenKit instance is fully initialized
bool success = openKit->waitForInitCompletion();
```

:grey_exclamation: Please refer to the Doxygen API documentation for additional information.

The method `waitForInitCompletion` blocks the calling thread until OpenKit is initialized. In case
of misconfiguration this might block the calling thread indefinitely. The return value
indicates whether the OpenKit instance has been initialized or `shutdown` has been called meanwhile.    
An overloaded method exists to wait a given amount of time for OpenKit to initialize as shown in the
following example.
```c++
// C++ API
// wait 10 seconds for OpenKit to complete initialization
int64_t timeoutInMilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
bool success = openKit->waitForInitCompletion(timeoutInMilliseconds);
```

The method returns `false` in case the timeout expired or `shutdown` has been invoked in the meantime
and `true` to indicate successful initialization.  

To verify if OpenKit has been initialized, use the `isInitialized` method as shown in the example below.
```java
boolean isInitialized = openKit.isInitialized();
if (isInitialized) {
    System.out.println("OpenKit is initialized");
} else {
    System.out.println("OpenKit is not yet initialized");
}
```

Both ways to wait for OpenKit's initialization are also available for OpenKit C.
```c
// C API
// wait until the OpenKit instance is fully initialized
bool success = waitForInitCompletion(openKit);
```

```c
// C API
// wait 10 seconds for OpenKit to complete initialization
int64_t timeoutInMilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
bool success = waitForInitCompletionWithTimeout(openKit, timeoutInMilliseconds);
```

## Creating a Session

After obtaining an `IOpenKit` instance from a builder,
an `ISession` can be created by invoking the `createSession` method.  
This method takes an IP address as string argument, which might be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
If the argument is not a valid IP address (including `nullptr`) a reasonable default value is used.


The example shows how to create sessions.
```c++
// C++ API
// create a session and pass an IP address
const char* clientIPAddress = "12.34.56.78";
std::shared_ptr<openkit::ISession> sessionWithIP = openKit->createSession(clientIPAddress);

// create a session and let the IP be assigned on the server side
std::shared_ptr<openkit::ISession> sessionWithNoIP = openKit->createSession(nullptr);
```

The following example shows how to create sessions in C.
```c
// C API
// create a session and pass an IP address
const char* clientIPAddress = "12.34.56.78";
struct SessionHandle* sessionWithIP = createSession(openKit, clientIPAddress);

// create a session and let the IP be assigned on the server side
struct SessionHandle* sessionWithNoIP = createSession(openKit, NULL);
```

## Identify User

Users can be identified by calling `identifyUser` on an `ISession` instance. This enables you to search and 
filter specific user sessions and analyze individual user behavior over time in the backend.

```c++
// C++ API
session->identifyUser("jane.doe@example.com");
```

With OpenKit's C API the same can be achieved by calling the `identifyUser` user function.

```c
// C API
identifyUser(session, "jane.doe@example.com");
```

## Finishing a Session

When an `ISession` is no longer needed, it should be ended by invoking the `end` method.  
Although all open sessions are automatically ended when OpenKit is shut down (see "Terminating the OpenKit instance")
it's highly recommended to end sessions which are no longer in use manually.

Due to C++ nature, it's also advisable to reset the shared pointer by assigning nullptr  to avoid
memory leaks.

```c++
// C++ API
session->end();
session = nullptr; // reset the shared pointer and decrease the reference count
```

When using the C API a session must be ended by calling `endSession`. This function
frees all allocated resources and therefore the `SessionHandle` is no longer valid
afterwards.

```c
// C API
endSession(session);
// session now points to an invalid memory location,
// therefore it's beneficial to assign NULL
session = NULL;
```


## Reporting a Crash

Unexpected application crashes can be reported via an `ISession` by invoking the `reportCrash` method.  
The example below shows how an exception might be reported.
```c++
// C++ API
    static int div(int numerator, int denominator)
    {
        if (denominator == 0)
        {
            throw std::runtime_error("division by zero")_;
        }
        return numerator / denominator;
    }

    static void divWithCrash()
    {
        int numerator = 5;
        int denominator = 0;
        try
        {
            std::cout << "Got: " << div(numerator, denominator) << std::endl;
        }
        catch (std::runtime_error& e)
        {
            const char* errorName = "std::runtime_error";
            String reason = e.what();
            const char* stacktrace = nullptr; // or use a real one
            // and now report the application crash via the session
            session->reportCrash(errorName, reason, stacktrace);
        }
    }
```

OpenKit's C API also allows reporting crashes as demonstrated in the snippet below.
```c
// C API
const char* errorName = "some error name";
const char* reason = "some reason";
const char* stacktrace = ""; // or use a real stack trace

reportCrash(session, errorName, reason, stacktrace);
```


## Starting a RootAction

As mentioned in the [README](#../README.md) root actions and actions are hierarchical named events, where
an `IRootAction` represents the first hierarchy level. An `IRootAction` can have child actions (`IAction`) and
is created from an `ISession` as shown in the example below.
```c++
// C++ API
const char* rootActionName = "rootActionName";
std::shared_ptr<IRootAction> rootAction = session->enterAction(rootActionName);
```

The following snippet demonstrates how the same can be achieved using OpenKit's C API by
calling the `enterRootAction` function.
```c
// C API
const char* rootActionName = "rootActionName";
struct RootActionHandle* rootAction = enterRootAction(session, rootActionName);
```


## Entering a Child Action

To start a child `IAction` from a previously started `IRootAction` use the `enterAction` method from
`IRootAction`, as demonstrated below.

```c++
// C++ API
const char* childActionName = "childActionName";
std::shared_ptr<IAction> childAction = rootAction->enterAction(childActionName);
```

The following snippet demonstrates how the same can be achieved using OpenKit's C API by
calling the `enterRootAction` function.
```c
// C API
const char* childActionName = "rootActionName";
struct RootActionHandle* childAction = enterAction(session, childActionName);
```

## Leaving Actions

To leave an `IAction` simply use the `leave` method. The method returns the parent action (`IRootAction`) or nothing
if it is an `IRootAction`.

Due to C++ nature it's also a good idea to reset the shared pointer by assigning `nullptr`.
This decreases the reference count and might clean up no longer needed resources.

```c++
// C++ API
std::shared_ptr<IRootAction> parentAction = action->leave(); // returns the appropriate IRootAction
action = nullptr; // decrease reference count and let shared ptr clean up

parentAction->leave();
parentAction = nullptr; // decrease reference count and let shared ptr clean up
```

Root Actions and Actions must be left when using OpenKit's C API. Calling the `leaveRootAction`
and `leaveAction` functions frees internally allocated resources. If those functions
are not invoked memory leaks will occur.
The following snippet demonstrates how this can be achieved.

Note: In contrary to the C++ API the C API function `leaveRootAction` does not return a value.

```c
// C API

// first leave the child action
leaveAction(childAction);
// Since the childAction now points to an invalid memory location
// it is a good idea to assign NULL to it.
childAction = NULL;

// now leave the root action
leaveRootAction(parentAction);
// Since the parentAction now points to an invalid memory location
// it is a good idea to assign NULL to it.
parentAction = NULL;
```

## Report Named Event

To report a named event use the `reportEvent` method on `IAction`.
```c++
// C++ API
const char* eventName = "eventName";
action->reportEvent(eventName);

// also report on the RootAction
rootAction->reportEvent(eventName);
```

The same can be achieved using the OpenKit C API as demonstrated below.

```c
// C API
const char* eventName = "eventName";
reportEventOnAction(action, eventName);

// also report on the RootAction
reportEventOnRootAction(rootAction, eventName);
```

## Report Key-Value Pairs

Key-value pairs can also be reported via an `IRootAction` or an `IAction` as shown in the example below.
Overloaded methods exist for the following value types:
* `int32_t`
* `double`
* `const char*`

```c++
// C++ API

// first report an int value
const char* keyIntType = "intType";
int32_t valueInt = 42;
action->reportValue(keyIntType, valueInt);
rootAction->reportValue(keyIntType, valueInt);

// then let's report a double value
const char* keyDoubleType = "doubleType";
double valueDouble = 3.141592653589793;
action->reportValue(keyDoubleType, valueDouble);
rootAction->reportValue(keyDoubleType, valueDouble);

// and also a string value
const char* keyStringType = "stringType";
const char* valueString = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
action->reportValue(keyStringType, valueString);
rootAction->reportValue(keyStringType, valueString);
```

The same can be achieved using the OpenKit C API as demonstrated below.

```c
// C API

// first report an int value
const char* keyIntType = "intType";
int32_t valueInt = 42;
reportIntValueOnAction(action, keyIntType, valueInt);
reportIntValueOnRootAction(rootAction, keyIntType, valueInt);

// then let's report a double value
const char* keyDoubleType = "doubleType";
double valueDouble = 3.141592653589793;
reportDoubleValueOnAction(action, keyDoubleType, valueDouble);
reportDoubleValueOnRootAction(rootAction, keyDoubleType, valueDouble);

// and also a string value
const char* keyStringType = "stringType";
const char* valueString = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
reportStringValueOnAction(action, keyStringType, valueString);
reportStringValueOnRootAction(rootAction, keyStringType, valueString);
```

## Report an Error

`IRootAction` and `IAction` also have the possibility to report an error with a given 
name, code and a reason. The code fragment below shows how.
```c++
// C++ API
const char* errorName = "Unknown Error";
int32_t errorCode = 42;
const char* reason = "Not sure what's going on here";

action->reportError(errorName, errorCode, reason);
rootAction->reportError(errorName, errorCode, reason);
```

The same can be achieved using the OpenKit C API as demonstrated below.

```c
// C API
const char* errorName = "Unknown Error";
int32_t errorCode = 42;
const char* reason = "Not sure what's going on here";

reportErrorOnAction(action, errorName, errorCode, reason);
reportErrorOnRootAction(rootAction, errorName, errorCode, reason);
```

## Tracing Web Requests

One of the most powerful OpenKit features is web request tracing. When the application starts a web
request (e.g. HTTP GET) a special tag can be attached to the header. This special header allows
Dynatrace SaaS/Dynatrace Managed/AppMon to correlate actions with a server side PurePath. 

An example is shown below.

```c++
// C++ API
const char* url = "http://www.my-backend.com/api/v3/users";


// create the WebRequestTracer
std::shared_ptr<IWebRequestTracer> webRequestTracer = action->traceWebRequest(url);

// Note: tracing web requests can also be done from rootActions
// std::shared_ptr<IWebRequestTracer> webRequestTracer = rootAction->traceWebRequest(url);

// this is the HTTP header name & value which needs to be added to the HTTP request.
const char* headerName = openkit::WEBREQUEST_TAG_HEADER;
const char* headerValue = webRequestTracer->getTag();

webRequestTracer->start();

// perform the request here & do not forget to add the HTTP header

webRequestTracer->setBytesSent(12345);     // 12345 bytes sent
webRequestTracer->setBytesReceived(67890); // 67890 bytes received
webRequestTracer->setResponseCode(200);    // 200 was the response code
webRequestTracer->stop();

// also reset the shared pointer after stop() method has been called
// to cleanup pointer
webRequestTracer = nullptr;
```

The same can be achieved using the OpenKit C API as demonstrated below.

```c
// C API
const char* url = "http://www.my-backend.com/api/v3/users";


// create the WebRequestTracer
struct WebRequestTracerHandle* webRequestTracer = traceWebRequestOnAction(action, url);

// Note: tracing web requests can also be done from rootActions
// struct WebRequestTracerHandle* webRequestTracer = traceWebRequestOnRootAction(rootAction, url);

// this is the HTTP header name & value which needs to be added to the HTTP request.
const char* headerName = WEBREQUEST_TAG_HEADER;
const char* headerValue = getTag(webRequestTracer);

startWebRequest(webRequestTracer);

// perform the request here & do not forget to add the HTTP header

setBytesSent(webRequestTracer, 12345);     // 12345 bytes sent
setBytesReceived(webRequestTracer, 67890); // 67890 bytes received
setResponseCode(webRequestTracer, 200);    // 200 was the response code
stopWebRequest(webRequestTracer);

// since webRequestTracer now points to an invalid memory
// location, it's recommended to set the pointer to NULL.
webRequestTracer = NULL;
```


## Terminating the OpenKit Instance

When an OpenKit instance is no longer needed (e.g. the application using OpenKit is shut down), the previously
obtained instance can be cleared by invoking the `shutdown` method.  
Calling the `shutdown` method blocks the calling thread while the OpenKit flushes data which has not been
transmitted yet to the backend (Dynatrace SaaS/Dynatrace Managed/AppMon).  
When using OpenKit's C API the same can be achieved by calling the `shutdownOpenKit` function.  
Details are explained in [internals.md](internals.md)
