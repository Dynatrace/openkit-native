 * std::this_thread::get_id returns a long value which is a hash from the std::thread::id class.
 * The Beacon protocol requires the thread id to be a positive integer value. By using the xor operation
 * between higher and lower 32 bits of the long value we get an integer value. The returned integer
 * can be negative though.
 * Therefore  the most significant bit is forced to '0' by a bitwise-and operation with an integer 
 * where all bits except for the most significant bit are set to '1'.
